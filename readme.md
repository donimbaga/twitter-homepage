## Why is this?

I'm re-making twitter homepage to learn HTML & CSS.

As experience seems to be a very good teacher than just reading tutorial
and trying out some simple examples.

Here I'm going to use only HTML & CSS to re-build a twitter homepage fit
in all kind of devices out there i.e adaptive.
